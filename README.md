# VISA
The project is capable of providing the future students with all the information from immigration to arriving in Canada, from applying to the University of Windsor to getting ready for Canadian winters. Gone is the era when a person had to clarify doubts on the phone or in person. This project consists of a chat-bot to interact with the user/student. The chat-bot is accessible via https://www.visabot.live. The project is fully documented so that a non-technical person can use it without getting any trouble.

<b>Motivation for the project</b>

Being an international student at the
University of Windsor is the real motivation behind helping fellow future
mates. All the processes we went through, from applying to the University of
Windsor to coming to Canada, from experiencing the Canadian culture to
watching the beautiful sunset at the Riverside, will be put in a tool that guides
the future international students by the effort of a click.
