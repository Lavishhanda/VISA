# visabot.live
The project is capable of providing the future students with all the information from immigration to arriving in Canada, from applying to the University of Windsor to getting ready for Canadian winters. Gone is the era when a person had to clarify doubts on the phone or in person. This project consists of a chat-bot to interact with the user/student. The chat-bot is accessible via https://www.visabot.live. The project is fully documented so that a non-technical person can use it without getting any trouble.
